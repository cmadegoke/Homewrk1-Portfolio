                            My name is catherine Adegoke. I am the Ceo of Yoni African Beads. Beads making has been in my generation for over thousand years .
                            According to My Great Grandmom, it was a  hobby for the women in the village till the europeans came to african and employed many women to mass produce the beads . 
                            These beads were made out of stones and Gold. In this era, we use any anything from Stones, plastics and Glass to 
                            then my elder sisters and finally to Me. I plan to teach my Daughters and their Daughters
