                            My name is Catherine Adegoke. I am the Ceo of Yoni African Beads. 
                            Bead Making has a long history in the Fante Tribe of Ghana. 
                            It was done mosty by women who presented their identity and position in society through <i>body ornaments and body painting.</i>
                            <br></br>Before the contact with the Europeans, the Beads were produced mostly from local raw materials. 
                            White beads were made from clay, shells, ivory or bone. 
                            Black and blue beads were made up of iron,charcoal,seeds,clay or horn. </br>

                        Today, our beads are made up of Glass, Gold and Plexiglass. 
                        Although there are varitions in the meaning of the color of beads, generally White Sinifies Peace, Blue signifies Water, Green the grass and Red for Bravery. 
                        <p id=beads>We mostly produce Bridal Beads in Red and Gold to signify the <strong>Beauty and Bravery</strong> of Marriage. </p>
